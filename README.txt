###Introduction
Here, I will show you how to create a digital clock using python. 
This is a simple task to get started with the Tkinter library in Python, which is a built-in package that comes with Python.
Tkinter has some really cool features that can be used to build simple apps.

###
To create a digital clock,first start with importing the libraries:
from tkinter import Label, Tk 
import time

Then 
->define the title and size of our application.
->define the font of the time and its colour, its border width and the background colour of the digital clock.
->combine all the elements to define the label of the clock application.
->define the main function of our digital clock.
